	<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>There are several pieces to the assessment to receive all 5 points -- all of which will be submitted through Github  by Wed., 10/30/19 - (to be done via a webpage based on a template from our Wk9-Assignments github or you can structure your own page if you'd prefer, but it must include all of these elements), with different headings for the different sections include the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>
3 citations, APA formatted for your paper (you will have done this in Monday's class and this will help for the paper that is due the following Monday). Hand it in using the html you know and look up to format it correctly, e.g., using <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;em&gt;</code></pre></li> to create italicized text as needed.
<li>
 A short (1 to 3 paragaph) reflection in a webpage (via <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></pre> marking up a section of your page, for example) on how libraries support student research in the internet age. Include what you learned from Monday's class. </li>
<li>A "description list" with the 4 aspects of computational thinking listed & briefly summarized (see: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl</a> for more on the <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></pre>element)</li>
<li>Begin the Javascript Intro & write 3 quiz questions from these section of reading at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction</a> &amp; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types">& https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types</a>, also using the <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></pre> for each question and answer</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Extra credit opportunity (up to 3 points):</h3>
<p>go to the Trick or Treat E-resources Fair at the library on Tuesday afternoon, 10/28, learn about one of the eresources at a booth and write a short summary/review of that eresource in a separate webpage</p>

	<p> Libraries support research in the internet age chiefly through online databases. Joy Hansen showed us how to use the CentralSearch catalog to easily find scholarly reviewed articles for our papers. These resources are also great because they automatically produce citations in any format.  </p>
